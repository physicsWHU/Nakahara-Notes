# 5.7 The action of Lie groups on manifolds

## 5.7.1 Definitions

>**Definition**: The action of Lie group $G$ on the manifold $M$ is characterized by a map $\sigma:G\times M\to M$ satisfying
> 1. $\sigma(e,p)=p$, for $\forall p\in M$.
> 2. $\sigma(g_1,\sigma(g_2,p))=\sigma(g_1g_2,p)$.

>**Note**: Now we introduce some terms to describe the actions
>- **Transitive**: $\forall p_1,p_2\in M,\exists g\in G,$ s.t. $\sigma(g,p_1)=p_2$.
>- **Free**: $\exists p\in M$ s.t. $\sigma(g,p)=p$, then $g=e$.
>- **Effective**: $\forall p\in M$ s.t. $\sigma(g,p)=p$, then $g=e$.


## 5.7.2 Orbits and isotropy groups

>**Definition (orbit)**: Given manifold $M$, Lie group $G$ acting on $M$ with action $\sigma$, the orbit of $p\in M$ is defined as
>$$Gp=\\{\sigma(g,p):g\in G\\}$$


>**Definition (isotropy group)**: The isotropy group of $p\in M$ is defined as
>$$H(p)=\\{g\in G:\sigma(g,p)=p\\}$$
>The isotropy group is also referred to as the **little group** or **stabilizer** of $p$.

>**Theorem**: An isotropy group $H(p)$ for $\forall p\in M$ is a Lie subgroup.

Further, we can define the quotient space $G/H(p)$ as the **homogeneous space**. We can also prove that under certain _technical requirements_, the homogeneous space is homeomorphic to $M$, as shown by several examples.


## 5.7.3 Induced vector fields

In this sector, we will try to ''induce'' vector fields in $M$ from a vector $V\in T_eG$.

>**Definition (induced vector fields)**: Given Lie group $G$, manifold $M$ and a left-invariant vector field $X_V$ generated by $V\in T_eG$. Define a flow in $M$ by
>$$\sigma: G\times M \to M;\quad (t, x)\mapsto \text{exp}(tV)x\equiv \phi_V(t)$$
>where $\sigma(t,x)$ is a one-parameter group of the transformations, the **induced vector field** is denoted by $V^\\#$
>$$\left V^\{hash\}\right|_\{x\}=\left\frac\{\mathrm{d}\}\{\mathrm{d}t\}\text{exp}(tV)x\right|_\{t=0\}$$
>Thus, we have obtained a map ''hash''$: T_eG\to \mathfrak{X}(M)$ defined by $V\mapsto$$V^\\#$. 


## 5.7.4 The adjoint representation

Consider a fun situation where a Lie group $G$ acts on itself in a special way.

>**Definition (adjoint representation)**: $\forall a\in G$ defines a homomorphism $\text{ad}_a:G\to G$ by the conjugation
>$$\text{ad}_a: g\mapsto aga^{-1}$$
>which is called the **adjoint representation** of $G$.

>**Definition (adjoint map)**: Define the **adjoint map** A$\text{d}_a$ out of the induced map of the adjoint representation $\text{ad}_\{a\star\}:T_gG\to T_\{\text{ad}_ag\}G$
>$$\text{Ad}_a:T_eG\to T_eG$$
>or we can write the map in terms of the corresponding Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}:
>$$\text{Ad}:G\times \mathfrak{g}\to \mathfrak{g}$$
