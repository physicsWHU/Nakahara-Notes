# Lie groups and Lie algebras

## 5.6.1 Lie groups

SO$(n)$ for example.

## 5.6.2 Lie algebras

\textgoth{so}($n$) $\mathscr{so}(n)$ for example.

## The one-parameter subgroup

Review that we have defined the one-parameter transformation $\sigma_t$ in Sec. 5.3, which form a group locally isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$.

>**Definition (one-parameter subgroup)**: A curve $\phi$
