As topological space focuses on _continuous_, manifold focus on _differentiable_ (_smoothness_)


# Differentiable maps
Let  $f: M \\rightarrow N$  be a map from an  _m_-dimensional manifold  $M$  to an  _n_-dimensional manifold  $N$. A point  $p \in M$  is mapped to a point  $f(p) \in N$ , namely  $f: p \mapsto f(p)$ . Take a chart  $(U, \varphi)$  on  $M$  and  $(V, \psi)$ on  $N$ , where  $p \in U$  and  $f(p) \in V$ . Then  $f$  has the following coordinate representation: $$\psi \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}: \mathbb{R}^{m} \\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$$ usually, write $\varphi(p)=\{x^{\mu}\}$ and $\psi(f(p))=\{y^{\alpha}\}$ (coordinate vector of space $\mathbb R^m,\mathbb R^n$), then $y=\psi \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}(x)$ is the vector-valued function of _m_ variables.

 > **Definition:**  differentiable (可微) and smooth
 > Say that the map $f$ is **differentiable** at $p$ or $x=f(p)$, if $y=\psi \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}(x)$ is $C^{\infty}$ with respect to each $x^{\mu}$. Differentiable maps are also said to be **smooth**.
 
 Clearly, a differentiable map is a map $\mathbb{R}^{m} \\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$ .

The differentiability of $f$ is independent of the coordinate system. ^1f5a5b
- **proof**:  Consider two overlapping charts  $\\left(U_ {1}, \varphi_ {1}\\right)$ and $\\left(U_ {2}, \varphi_ {2}\\right)$ . Take a point  $p \in U_ {1} \cap U_ {2}$ , whose coordinates by  $\varphi_ {1}$  are  $\{x_ {1}^{\mu}\}$ , while those by  $\varphi_ {2}$  are  $\{x_ {2}^{\nu}\}$ . When expressed in terms of  $\{x_ {1}^{\mu}\}$, $f$  takes the form  $\psi \circ f \circ \varphi_ {1}^{-1}$ , while in  $\{x_ {2}^{\nu}\}$, $\psi \circ f \circ \varphi_ {2}^{-1}=  \psi \circ f \circ \varphi_ {1}^{-1}\\left(\varphi_ {1} \circ \varphi_ {2}^{-1}\\right)$ . By definition,  $\psi_ {12}=\varphi_ {1} \circ \varphi_ {2}^{-1}$  . In the simpler expressions, they correspond to  $y=f\\left(x_ {1}\\right)$ . It is clear that if  $f\\left(x_ {1}\\right)$  is  $C^{\infty}$  with respect to  $x_ {1}^{\mu}$  and  $x_ {1}\\left(x_ {2}\\right)$  is  $C^{\infty}$  with respect to  $x_2^v$   is also  $C^{\infty}$  with respect to  $x_ {2}^{v}$ .




> **Definition:**  diffeomorphism (微分同胚)
> Let  $f: M \\rightarrow N$  be a _homeomorphism_ and  $\psi$  and  $\varphi$  be coordinate functions as previously defined. If  $\psi \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}$  is invertible (that is, there exists a map $\varphi \circ f^{-1} \circ \psi^{-1}$ ) and both  $y=\psi \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}(x)$ and  $x=\varphi \circ f^{-1} \circ \psi^{-1}(y)$  are  $C^{\infty}$, $f$  is called a **diffeomorphism** and  $M$  is said to **be diffeomorphic to**  $N$  and _vice versa_, denoted by  $M \equiv N$.

- **remark1:** Diffeomorphism reveals that two space can be well discribed by coordinates and the coordinates can be transitted **smoothly** to each other. 
- **remark2:** Two diffeomorphic spaces are regarded as the same manifold. 
- **remark3:** A diffeomorphism is a homeomorphis, but a homeomorphis is no need to be  a diffeomorphism.

==Here we assume that a manifold admits a unique differentiable structure, for simplicity.==

## Views of coordinate transformation
The set of diffeomorphisms $f : M \to M$ is a group denoted by $\operatorname{Diff}(M)$. 

- _active_ point of view
Take a point $p$ in a chart $(U, \varphi)$ such that $\varphi(p) = x^{\mu}(p)$. Under $f \in \operatorname{Diff}(M)$, $p$ is mapped to $f (p)$ whose coordinates are $\varphi( f (p)) = y^{\mu}( f (p))$ (we have assumed $f (p) \in U$). Clearly $y$ is a differentiable function of $x$;


- _Passive_ point of view 
If $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ are overlapping charts, we have two coordinate values $x^{\mu}=\varphi(p)$ and $y^{\mu}=\psi(p)$ for a point $p\in U\cap V$. The map $x\mapsto y$ is differentiable by the assumed smoothness of the manifold  



## Curve and functions
> **definition:** curve
> An open curve in an _m_-dimensional manifold $M$ is a map $c:(a,b)\to M$, where $(a,b)$ is a open interval such that $a(\text{or} -\infty)<0<b(\text{ or } +\infty)$. We have included 0 in the interval for later convenience.
>  - the coordinate presentation: $$x=\varphi \circ c: \mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m}$$


**P. S** if a curve is closed, it is regarded as a map $c:S^1\to M$ .

> **definiton:** function
> A function  $f$ on $M$ is a smooth map from $M$ to $\mathbb R$. 
>  - the coordinate presentation: $$f\circ \varphi^{-1}: \mathbb{R} ^{m}\\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$
> - the set of smooth functions on $M$ is denoted by $\mathcal F(M)$

## Vectors
We come to define geometrical objects after defining maps on the manifold. Obviously, we can't define a _'straight'_ vector on a manifold or curved surface, intuitively. So we include **tangent vector**.

To define a tangent vector we need a curve $c:(a,b)\to M$ and a function $f:M\to \mathbb R$, where $(a, b)$ is an open interval containing $t = 0$, see figure below.

The rate of change of $f (c(t))$ at $t=0$ :

$$\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} f(c(t))}{\mathrm{d} t}\right|_ {t=0}$$

Then represent in terms of the local coordinate $x^{\mu}$ :
$$\\left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^{\mu}} \frac{\mathrm{d} x^{\mu}(c(t))}{\mathrm{d} t}\\right|_ {t=0}$$
- **attention:**  we denote the derivative by $\partial f/\partial x^{\mu}$ just for convenience, which it's really means $\partial (f\circ \varphi^{-1})/\partial x^{\mu}$  

> **definition:** tangent vector 
> Denote the latter derivative above by a operator:
> $$X=X^{\mu}\\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}\\right) \quad\\left(X^{\mu}=\\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} x^{\mu}(c(t))}{\mathrm{d} t}\\right|_ {t=0}\\right)$$
>
>  that is $$\\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} f(c(t))}{\mathrm{d} t}\\right|_ {t=0}=X^{\mu}\\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^{\mu}}\\right) \equiv X[f]$$
>  we define $X$ is the **tangent vector** to $M$ at $p=c(0)$.

_Exp._ If $X$ is applied to the coordinate functions $\varphi (c(t)) = x^{\mu}(t)$, we have $$X\\left[x^{\mu}\\right]=\\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} x^{v}}{\mathrm{d} t}\\right)\\left(\frac{\partial x^{\mu}}{\partial x^{v}}\\right)=\\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} x^{\mu}(t)}{\mathrm{d} t}\\right|_ {t=0}$$
### Tangent space
Introduce an equivalence class of curves in $M$.
> If two curves $c_1(t)$ and $c_2(t)$ satisfy:
>
>$$\begin{array}{l}
(i) &c_ {1}(0)=c_ {2}(0)=p \\\\
(ii) &\\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} (x^{\mu}(c_ {1}(t))}{\mathrm{d} t}\\right|_ {t=0}=\\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} (x^{\mu}(c_ {2}(t))}{\mathrm{d} t}\\right|_ {t=0}
\end{array}$$

>$c_1(t)$ and $c_2(t)$ yield the same differential operator $X$ to $p$, in which case we define $c_1(t)\sim c_2(t)$.
> Then we identify the _tangent vector_ $X$ with the class of curves $$[c(t)]=\{\tilde{c}(t) \mid \widetilde{c}(0)=c(0) \text{ and }\\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} x^{\mu}(\widetilde{c}(t))}{\mathrm{d} t}\\right|_ {t=0}=\\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} x^{\mu}(c(t))}{\mathrm{d} t}\\right|_ {t=0}\}$$

All the equivalence classes of curves at $p\in M$, namely all the tangent
Vectors at $p$, form a vector space called the **tangent space** of $M$ at $p$, denoted by $T_pM$. Evidently $\dim T_pM=\dim M$ 

To analyse $T_pM$, we should introduce some conception:
- The basis vectors of $T_pM$ are $e_ {\mu}=\partial / \partial x^{\mu}(1 \leq \mu \leq m)$ and $\{e_ {\mu}\}$ is called **coordinate basis** or [holonomic basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomic_basis).

- If a vector $V \in T_pM$ is written as $V = V^{\mu}e_ {\mu}$, the numbers $V^{\mu}$ are called the components of $V$ with respect to $e_ {\mu}$.

- The vectors are independent with coordinate, so they have transformation property of the components of the vector.
Let $p \in U_ {i} \cap U_ {j} \text { and } x=\varphi_ {i}(p), y=\varphi_ {j}(p)$, then $$X=X^{\mu} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}=\widetilde{X}^{\mu} \frac{\partial}{\partial y^{\mu}}$$ This shows that $X^{\mu}$ and $X^{\mu}$ are related as $$\widetilde{X}^{\mu}=X^{v} \frac{\partial y^{\mu}}{\partial x^{v}}$$

Of course, The basis of $T_pM$ need not be $\{e_ {\mu}\}$. If $\hat{e}_ {i} \equiv A_ {i}{ }^{\mu} e_ {\mu},$ where $A=\\left(A_ {i}^{\mu}\\right) \in \operatorname{GL}(m, \mathbb{R})$, the basis $\{\hat{e}_ {i}\}$ is known as the **non-coordinate basis**.
(the non-coordinate basis can not form a coordinate system. Ref [[exp. of coordinate basis]]) 

# One-forms (dual space)
There are a dual vector space for $T_pM$ whose element is a linear function from $T_pM$ to $\mathbb R$. The [[Dual vector space|dual space]] is called the **cotangent space** at $p$, denoted by $T_p^*M$.

An element $\omega: T_pM\to \mathbb　R$ of $T_p^*M$ is called a **dual vector**, **cotangent vector**, or **one-form**.

Since action on a vector can be represented by inner product 
Here comes a simplest _example_: 
$$\langle\mathrm{d} f, V\rangle \equiv V[f]=V^{\mu} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^{\mu}} \in \mathbb{R}$$ where $\mathrm d f\in T^*_pM, V\in T_pM$ 

## Basis 
Since $\mathrm d f=\\left(\partial f / \partial x^{\mu}\\right) \mathrm{d} x^{\mu}$, and $\mathrm d f\in T^*_pM$, it is natural to regard $\{\mathrm d x^{\mu}\}$

as a basis of $T^*_pM$ . Moreover this is a dual basis

$$\langle\mathrm{d} x^{\mu}, \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}\rangle=\frac{\partial x^{v}}{\partial x^{\mu}}=\delta_ {\mu}^{v}$$

So An arbitrary one-form $\omega$ is written as

$$\omega=\omega_\mu \mathrm d x^{\mu}$$

Where the $\omega_\mu$ are the components of $\omega$.

The action $\omega$ on a vector $V=V^{\mu} \partial / \partial x^{\mu}$ can be represented by the **inner product** $\langle\quad, \quad\rangle: T_ {p}^{*} M \times T_ {p} M \\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ 
$$\langle\omega, V\rangle=\omega_ {\mu} V^{v}\langle\mathrm{d} x^{\mu}, \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{v}}\rangle=\omega_ {\mu} V^{v} \delta_ {v}^{\mu}=\omega_ {\mu} V^{\mu}$$

- $\omega$ is defined without reference to any coordinate system, for a point $p \in U_ {i} \cap U_ {j}$ , we have  $$\omega=\omega_ {\mu} \mathrm{d} x^{\mu}=\widetilde{\omega}_ {v} \mathrm{d} y^{v}$$
Where $x=\varphi_ {i}(p)$ and $y=\varphi_ {j}(p)$ 



# Tensors 
$\mathcal T^q_ {r,p}(M)$ denotes the set of type $(q,r)$ tensors at $p\in M$, which maps $q$ elements of $T_p^*M$ and $r$ elements of $T_pM$ to a real number.

An element of $\mathcal T^q_ {r,p}(M)$ is written as:
$$T=T^{\mu_ {1} \ldots \mu_ {q}} _ {\quad\quad\quad v_ {1} \ldots v_ {r}} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu_ {1}}} \ldots \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu_ {q}}} \mathrm{d} x^{v_ {1}} \ldots \mathrm{d} x^{v_ {r}}$$
Where $T^{\mu_ {1} \ldots \mu_ {q}} _ {\quad\quad\quad v_ {1} \ldots v_ {r}}$ are coefficients, $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu_ {1}}} \ldots \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu_ {q}}}$ are bases of $T_pM$ and $\mathrm{d} x^{v_ {1}} \ldots \mathrm{d} x^{v_ {r}}$ are bases of $T^*_pM$ 

Clear is a linear function: 
$$T:\otimes^{q} T_ {p}^{*} M \otimes^{r} T_ {p} M\to\mathbb R$$
Let $V_ {i}=V_ {i}^{\mu} \partial / \partial x^{\mu}(1 \leq i \leq r)$ and $\omega_ {i}=\omega_ {i \mu} \mathrm{d} x^{\mu}(1 \leq i \leq q)$ . The action of $T$ on them yields a number
$$T\\left(\omega_ {1}, \ldots, \omega_ {q} ; V_ {1}, \ldots, V_ {r}\\right)=T^{\mu_ {1} \ldots \mu_ {q}} _ {\quad\quad\quad v_ {1} \ldots v_ {r}} \omega_ {1\mu_ {1}} \ldots \omega_ {q \mu_ {q}} V_ {1}^{v_ {1}} \ldots V_ {r}^{v_ {r}}$$


# Tensor fields
> **definition** vector field 
> If a vector is assigned smoothly to each point of $M$, it is called a **vector field** over $M$. Or in precise words, $W$ is a vector field if $W[ f ] \in \mathcal F(M)$ for any $f \in \mathcal F(M)$.
> - ref: [[#^6908e4|F(M)]] 

Clearly each component of a vector field is a smooth function from $M \to \mathbb R$. ( $V^{\mu}(\partial f)/(\partial x^{\mu})$ )

- Notation:
	- The set of the vector fields on $M$ is denoted as $\mathcal X(M)$.
	- A vector field $X$ at $p \in  M$ is denoted by $X|_p$, which is an element of $T_pM$.


>**definition** tensor field
>If a tensor of type $(q, r)$ which is an element of $\mathcal T^q_ {r,p} (M)$ is assigned smoothly to each point $p \in M$ , it is called **tensor field**. 

- Notation:
	- The set of the tensor fields of type $(q, r )$ on $M$ is denoted by $\mathcal T_r^q(M)$. For example, $\mathcal T^0_1(M)$ is the set of the dual vector fields.


# Induced maps


A smooth map $f : M → N$ naturally induces a map $f_∗$ called the **differential map** (pushforward) 

$$f_ {*}: T_ {p} M \\rightarrow T_ {f(p)} N$$

Give the explicit form of $f_*$ below:
If $g\in \mathcal F(N)$, then $g\circ f: M\to \mathbb R$ which is $g\circ f\in \mathcal F(M)$. A vector $V\in T_pM$ acting on $g\circ f$ is represented by $V[g\circ f]$. Now defined a vector $f_ {*} V \in T_ {f(p)} N$ by 

$$\\left(f_ {*} V\\right)[g] \equiv V[g \circ f]$$

Or in terms of charts $(U, \varphi)$ on $M$ and $(V , \psi)$ on $N$. 

$$\\left(f_ {*} V\\right)\\left[g \circ \psi^{-1}(y)\\right] \equiv V\\left[g \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}(x)\\right]$$

Where $x=\varphi(p)$ and $y=\psi(f(p))$ . ^ae3c57

- The explicit form:
Let $V=V^{\mu} \partial / \partial x^{\mu}$ and $f_ {*} V=W^{\alpha} \partial / \partial y^{\alpha} \text {. }$ then 

$$W^{\alpha} \frac{\partial}{\partial y^{\alpha}}\\left[g \circ \psi^{-1}(y)\\right]=V^{\mu} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}\\left[g \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}(x)\\right] .$$

- Relation of coordinate in different vector space
If take $g=y^{\alpha}$ then we obtain the relation of $W^\alpha$ and $V_\mu$

$$W^{\alpha}=V^{\mu} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}} y^{\alpha}(x)$$

Which is [[jacobian 行列式|Jacobian]] of the map $f:M\to N$.

- Exercise


## Pullback
A map $f : M\to N$ also induces a map 

$$f^*: T_{f(p)}^* N \rightarrow T_{p}^{*} M$$

Note that $f_*$ goes in the same direction as $f$ ($M\to N$), but $f^*$ goes backward ($N\to M$), hence the name **pullback**. 

If we take $V \in T_pM$ and $\omega \in T^∗_ {f (p)}N$, the pullback of $\omega$ by $f^∗$ is defined by

$$\langle f^* \omega, V\rangle=\langle\omega, f_ * V\rangle .$$

The pullback $f^∗$ naturally extends to tensors of type $(0, r )$, $f^∗ : \mathcal T^0_ {r,f(p)}(N)\to \mathcal T^0_ {r,p}(M)$  


# Submanifolds
> **definition:**  Immersion, submanifold, embedding
> Let $f : M \to N$ be a smooth map and let $\dim M \leqslant \dim N$.
> 1. The map $f$ is called an **immersion** of $M$ into $N$ if $f_* : T_pM → T_ {f (p)}N$ is an injection (one to one), that is rank $f_* = \dim M$.
> 
> 2. The map $f$ is called an **embedding** if $f$ is an injection and an immersion. The image $f (M)$ is called a **submanifold** of $N$. \[In practice, $f (M)$ thus defined is diffeomorphic to $M$.]

- remarks
	- If $f$ is an immersion, ==$f_∗$ maps $T_pM$ isomorphically to an m-dimensional== vector subspace of $T_ {f (p)}N$ since rank $f_∗ = \dim M$
	- If f is an embedding, $M$ is diffeomorphic to $f (M)$.
	- Clearly, an embedding is an immersion although the converse is not necessarily true.
