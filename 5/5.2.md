As topological space focuses on \_continuous\_, manifold focus on \_differentiable\_ (\_smoothness\_)


# Differentiable maps
Let  $f: M \rightarrow N$  be a map from an  \_m\_-dimensional manifold  $M$  to an  \_n\_-dimensional manifold  $N$. A point  $p \in M$  is mapped to a point  $f(p) \in N$ , namely  $f: p \mapsto f(p)$ , see **fig1**. Take a chart  $(U, \varphi)$  on  $M$  and  $(V, \psi)$ on  $N$ , where  $p \in U$  and  $f(p) \in V$ . Then  $f$  has the following coordinate representation: $$\psi \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}: \mathbb{R}^{m} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$$ usually, write $\varphi(p)= \left\\{x^{\mu}\right \\}$ and $\psi(f(p))=\left\\{y^{\alpha}\right\\}$ (coordinate vector of space $\mathbb R^m,\mathbb R^n$), then $y=\psi \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}(x)$ is the vector-valued function of \_m\_ variables.

 > **Definition:**  differentiable (可微) and smooth
 > Say that the map $f$ is **differentiable** at $p$ or $x=f(p)$, if $y=\psi \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}(x)$ is $C^{\infty}$ with respect to each $x^{\mu}$. Differentiable maps are also said to be **smooth**.
 
 Clearly, a differentiable map is a map $\mathbb{R}^{m} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$ .

The differentiability of $f$ is independent of the coordinate system. ^1f5a5b
- **proof**:  Consider two overlapping charts  $\left(U\_{1}, \varphi\_{1}\right)$ and $\left(U\_{2}, \varphi\_{2}\right)$ . Take a point  $p \in U\_{1} \cap U\_{2}$ , whose coordinates by  $\varphi\_{1}$  are  $\left\\{x\_{1}^{\mu}\right\\}$ , while those by  $\varphi\_{2}$  are  $\left\\{x\_{2}^{\nu}\right\\}$ . When expressed in terms of  $\left\\{x\_{1}^{\mu}\right\\}$, $f$  takes the form  $\psi \circ f \circ \varphi\_{1}^{-1}$ , while in  $\left\\{x\_{2}^{\nu}\right\\}$, $\psi \circ f \circ \varphi\_{2}^{-1}=  \psi \circ f \circ \varphi\_{1}^{-1}\left(\varphi\_{1} \circ \varphi\_{2}^{-1}\right)$ . By definition,  $\psi\_{12}=\varphi\_{1} \circ \varphi\_{2}^{-1}$  . In the simpler expressions, they correspond to  $y=f\left(x\_{1}\right)$ . It is clear that if  $f\left(x\_{1}\right)$  is  $C^{\infty}$  with respect to  $x\_{1}^{\mu}$  and  $x\_{1}\left(x\_{2}\right)$  is  $C^{\infty}$  with respect to  $x\_2^v$   is also  $C^{\infty}$  with respect to  $x\_{2}^{v}$ .




> **Definition:**  diffeomorphism (微分同胚)
> Let  $f: M \rightarrow N$  be a \_homeomorphism\_ and  $\psi$  and  $\varphi$  be coordinate functions as previously defined. If  $\psi \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}$  is invertible (that is, there exists a map $\varphi \circ f^{-1} \circ \psi^{-1}$ ) and both  $y=\psi \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}(x)$ and  $x=\varphi \circ f^{-1} \circ \psi^{-1}(y)$  are  $C^{\infty}$, $f$  is called a **diffeomorphism** and  $M$  is said to **be diffeomorphic to**  $N$  and \_vice versa\_, denoted by  $M \equiv N$.

- **remark1:** Diffeomorphism reveals that two space can be well described by coordinates and the coordinates can be transited **smoothly** to each other. 
- **remark2:** Two diffeomorphic spaces are regarded as the same manifold. 
- **remark3:** A diffeomorphism is a homeomorphism, but a homeomorphism is no need to be  a diffeomorphism.

==Here we assume that a manifold admits a unique differentiable structure, for simplicity.==

## Views of coordinate transformation
The set of diffeomorphisms $f : M \to M$ is a group denoted by $\operatorname{Diff}(M)$. 

- \_active\_ point of view
Take a point $p$ in a chart $(U, \varphi)$ such that $\varphi(p) = x^{\mu}(p)$. Under $f \in \operatorname{Diff}(M)$, $p$ is mapped to $f (p)$ whose coordinates are $\varphi( f (p)) = y^{\mu}( f (p))$ (we have assumed $f (p) \in U$). Clearly $y$ is a differentiable function of $x$;



- \_Passive\_ point of view 
If $(U,\varphi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ are overlapping charts, we have two coordinate values $x^{\mu}=\varphi(p)$ and $y^{\mu}=\psi(p)$ for a point $p\in U\cap V$. The map $x\mapsto y$ is differentiable by the assumed smoothness of the manifold  




## Curve and functions
> **definition:** curve
> An open curve in an \_m\_-dimensional manifold $M$ is a map $c:(a,b)\to M$, where $(a,b)$ is a open interval such that $a(\text{or} -\infty)<0<b(\text{or} +\infty)$. We have included 0 in the interval for later convenience.

>  - the coordinate presentation: $$x=\varphi \circ c: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m}$$


**P. S** if a curve is closed, it is regarded as a map $c:S^1\to M$ .

> **definition:** function
> A function  $f$ on $M$ is a smooth map from $M$ to $\mathbb R$. 

>  - the coordinate presentation: $$f\circ \varphi^{-1}: \mathbb{R} ^{m}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$
> - the set of smooth functions on $M$ is denoted by $\mathcal F(M)$ 



## Vectors
We come to define geometrical objects after defining maps on the manifold. Obviously, we can't define a \_'straight'\_ vector on a manifold or curved surface, intuitively. So we include **tangent vector**.

To define a tangent vector we need a curve $c:(a,b)\to M$ and a function $f:M\to \mathbb R$, where $(a, b)$ is an open interval containing $t = 0$, see figure below.


The rate of change of $f (c(t))$ at $t=0$ :

$$\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} f(c(t))}{\mathrm{d} t}\right|\_{t=0}$$

Then represent in terms of the local coordinate $x^{\mu}$ :
$$\left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^{\mu}} \frac{\mathrm{d} x^{\mu}(c(t))}{\mathrm{d} t}\right|\_{t=0}$$
- **attention:**  we denote the derivative by $\partial f/\partial x^{\mu}$ just for convenience, which it's really means $\partial (f\circ \varphi^{-1})/\partial x^{\mu}$  

> **definition:** tangent vector 
> Denote the latter derivative above by a operator:
>  
> $$X=X^{\mu}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}\right) \quad\left(X^{\mu}=\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} x^{\mu}(c(t))}{\mathrm{d} t}\right|\_{t=0}\right)$$
>
>  that is $$\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} f(c(t))}{\mathrm{d} t}\right|\_{t=0}=X^{\mu}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^{\mu}}\right) \equiv X[f]$$
>  we define $X$ is the **tangent vector** to $M$ at $p=c(0)$.

\_Exp.\_ If $X$ is applied to the coordinate functions $\varphi (c(t)) = x^{\mu}(t)$, we have 

$$X\left[x^{\mu}\right]=\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} x^{v}}{\mathrm{d} t}\right)\left(\frac{\partial x^{\mu}}{\partial x^{v}}\right)=\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} x^{\mu}(t)}{\mathrm{d} t}\right|\_{t=0}$$

### Tangent space
Introduce an equivalence class of curves in $M$.
> If two curves $c\_1(t)$ and $c\_2(t)$ satisfy:
> 
>$$\begin{array}{l}
(i)  & c\_{1}(0)=c\_{2}(0)=p \\\\ (ii) &  \frac{\mathrm{d} x^{\mu} (c\_{1}(t))}{\mathrm{d} t}\bigg|\_{t=0}=\frac{\mathrm{d} x^{\mu}(c\_{2}(t))}{\mathrm{d} t}\bigg |\_{t=0} 
\end{array}$$
>
>$c\_1(t)$ and $c\_2(t)$ yield the same differential operator $X$ to $p$, in which case we define $c\_1(t)\sim c\_2(t)$.
> Then we identify the \_tangent vector\_ $X$ with the class of curves 
>
>$$[c(t)]=\left\\{\tilde{c}(t) \mid \widetilde{c}(0)=c(0) \text { and }\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} x^{\mu}(\widetilde{c}(t))}{\mathrm{d} t}\right|\_{t=0}=\left.\frac{\mathrm{d} x^{\mu}(c(t))}{\mathrm{d} t}\right|\_{t=0}\right\\}$$

All the equivalence classes of curves at $p\in M$, namely all the tangent
Vectors at $p$, form a vector space called the **tangent space** of $M$ at $p$, denoted by $T\_pM$. Evidently $\dim T\_pM=\dim M$ 

To analyse $T\_pM$, we should introduce some conception:
- The basis vectors of $T\_pM$ are $e\_{\mu}=\partial / \partial x^{\mu}(1 \leq \mu \leq m)$ and $\\{e\_{\mu}\\}$ is called **coordinate basis** or [holonomic basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomic\_basis).

- If a vector $V \in T\_pM$ is written as $V = V^{\mu}e\_{\mu}$, the numbers $V^{\mu}$ are called the components of $V$ with respect to $e\_{\mu}$.

- The vectors are independent with coordinate, so they have transformation property of the components of the vector.
Let $p \in U\_{i} \cap U\_{j} \text { and } x=\varphi\_{i}(p), y=\varphi\_{j}(p)$, then $$X=X^{\mu} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}=\widetilde{X}^{\mu} \frac{\partial}{\partial y^{\mu}}$$ This shows that $X^{\mu}$ and $X^{\mu}$ are related as $$\widetilde{X}^{\mu}=X^{v} \frac{\partial y^{\mu}}{\partial x^{v}}$$

Of course, The basis of $T\_pM$ need not be $\\{e\_{\mu}\\}$. If $\hat{e}\_{i} \equiv A\_{i}{ }^{\mu} e\_{\mu},$ where $A=\left(A\_{i}^{\mu}\right) \in \operatorname{GL}(m, \mathbb{R})$, the basis $\\{\hat{e}\_{i}\\}$ is known as the **non-coordinate basis**.
(the non-coordinate basis can not form a coordinate system. Ref [[exp. of coordinate basis]]) 

# One-forms (dual space)
There are a dual vector space for $T\_pM$ whose element is a linear function from $T\_pM$ to $\mathbb R$. The [[Dual vector space|dual space]] is called the **cotangent space** at $p$, denoted by $T\_p^*M$.

An element $\omega: T\_pM\to \mathbb　R$ of $T\_p^*M$ is called a **dual vector**, **cotangent vector**, or **one-form**. ^553a1a

Since action on a vector can be represented by inner product 

Here comes a simplest \_example\_: 

$$\langle\mathrm{d} f, V\rangle \equiv V[f]=V^{\mu} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^{\mu}} \in \mathbb{R}$$ 

where $\mathrm d f\in T^*\_pM, V\in T\_pM$ 

## Basis 
Since $\mathrm d f=\left(\partial f / \partial x^{\mu}\right) \mathrm{d} x^{\mu}$, and $\mathrm d f\in T^\*\_pM$ , it is natural to regard $\\{\mathrm d x^{\mu}\\}$ as a basis of $T^*\_pM$ . Moreover this is a [[Dual vector space#Basis|dual basis]] 

$$\left\langle\mathrm{d} x^{\mu}, \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}\right\rangle=\frac{\partial x^{v}}{\partial x^{\mu}}=\delta\_{\mu}^{v}$$ 

So An arbitrary one-form $\omega$ is written as
$$\omega=\omega\_\mu \mathrm d x^{\mu}$$
Where the $\omega\_\mu$ are the components of $\omega$.

The action $\omega$ on a vector $V=V^{\mu} \partial / \partial x^{\mu}$ can be represented by the **inner product** $\langle\quad, \quad\rangle: T\_{p}^{*} M \times T\_{p} M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ 

$$\langle\omega, V\rangle=\omega\_{\mu} V^{v}\left\langle\mathrm{d} x^{\mu}, \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{v}}\right\rangle=\omega\_{\mu} V^{v} \delta\_{v}^{\mu}=\omega\_{\mu} V^{\mu}$$

- $\omega$ is defined without reference to any coordinate system, for a point $p \in U\_{i} \cap U\_{j}$ , we have  $$\omega=\omega\_{\mu} \mathrm{d} x^{\mu}=\widetilde{\omega}\_{v} \mathrm{d} y^{v}$$
Where $x=\varphi\_{i}(p)$ and $y=\varphi\_{j}(p)$ 

- like vectors, the transition between two one-form is:

$$\xi^{\mu}=\omega^{v} \frac{\partial y^{\mu}}{\partial x^{v}}$$ 

# Tensors 
$\mathcal T^q\_{r,p}(M)$ denotes the set of type $(q,r)$ tensors at $p\in M$, which maps $q$ elements of $T\_p^*M$ and $r$ elements of $T\_pM$ to a real number.

An element of $\mathcal T^q\_{r,p}(M)$ is written as:
$$T=T^{\mu\_{1} \ldots \mu\_{q}} \_{\quad\quad\quad v\_{1} \ldots v\_{r}} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu\_{1}}} \ldots \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu\_{q}}} \mathrm{d} x^{v\_{1}} \ldots \mathrm{d} x^{v\_{r}}$$
Where $T^{\mu\_{1} \ldots \mu\_{q}} \_{\quad\quad\quad v\_{1} \ldots v\_{r}}$ are coefficients, $\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu\_{1}}} \ldots \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu\_{q}}}$ are bases of $T\_pM$ and $\mathrm{d} x^{v\_{1}} \ldots \mathrm{d} x^{v\_{r}}$ are bases of $T^*\_pM$ 

Clear is a linear function: 
$$T:\otimes^{q} T\_{p}^{*} M \otimes^{r} T\_{p} M\to\mathbb R$$
Let $V\_{i}=V\_{i}^{\mu} \partial / \partial x^{\mu}(1 \leq i \leq r)$ and $\omega\_{i}=\omega\_{i \mu} \mathrm{d} x^{\mu}(1 \leq i \leq q)$ . The action of $T$ on them yields a number
$$T\left(\omega\_{1}, \ldots, \omega\_{q} ; V\_{1}, \ldots, V\_{r}\right)=T^{\mu\_{1} \ldots \mu\_{q}} \_{\quad\quad\quad v\_{1} \ldots v\_{r}} \omega\_{1\mu\_{1}} \ldots \omega\_{q \mu\_{q}} V\_{1}^{v\_{1}} \ldots V\_{r}^{v\_{r}}$$


# Tensor fields
> **definition** vector field 
> If a vector is assigned smoothly to each point of $M$, it is called a **vector field** over $M$. Or in precise words, $W$ is a vector field if $W[ f ] \in \mathcal F(M)$ for any $f \in \mathcal F(M)$.
> - ref: [[#^6908e4|F(M)]] 

Clearly each component of a vector field is a smooth function from $M \to \mathbb R$. ( $V^{\mu}(\partial f)/(\partial x^{\mu})$ )

- Notation:
	- The set of the vector fields on $M$ is denoted as $\mathcal X(M)$.
	- A vector field $X$ at $p \in  M$ is denoted by $X|\_p$, which is an element of $T\_pM$.


>**definition** tensor field
>If a tensor of type $(q, r)$ which is an element of $\mathcal T^q\_{r,p} (M)$ is assigned smoothly to each point $p \in M$ , it is called **tensor field**. 

- Notation:
	- The set of the tensor fields of type $(q, r )$ on $M$ is denoted by $\mathcal T\_r^q(M)$. For example, $\mathcal T^0\_1(M)$ is the set of the dual vector fields.


# Induced maps

A smooth map $f : M → N$ naturally induces a map $f\_∗$ called the **differential map** (pushforward) $$f\_{\*}: T\_{p} M \rightarrow T\_{f(p)} N$$
Give the explicit form of $f\_\*$ below:
If $g\in \mathcal F(N)$, then $g\circ f: M\to \mathbb R$ which is $g\circ f\in \mathcal F(M)$. A vector $V\in T\_pM$ acting on $g\circ f$ is represented by $V[g\circ f]$. Now defined a vector $f\_{\*} V \in T\_{f(p)} N$ by $$\left(f\_{\*} V\right)[g] \equiv V[g \circ f]$$
Or in terms of charts $(U, \varphi)$ on $M$ and $(V , \psi)$ on $N$. 

$$\left(f\_{\*} V\right)\left[g \circ \psi^{-1}(y)\right] \equiv V\left[g \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}(x)\right]$$

Where $x=\varphi(p)$ and $y=\psi(f(p))$ . 

- The explicit form:
Let $V=V^{\mu} \partial / \partial x^{\mu}$ and $f\_{*} V=W^{\alpha} \partial / \partial y^{\alpha} \text {. }$ then 
$$W^{\alpha} \frac{\partial}{\partial y^{\alpha}}\left[g \circ \psi^{-1}(y)\right]=V^{\mu} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}\left[g \circ f \circ \varphi^{-1}(x)\right] .$$
If take $g=y^{\alpha}$ then we obtain the relation of $W^\alpha$ and $V^\mu$
$$W^{\alpha}=V^{\mu} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}} y^{\alpha}(x)$$
Which is [[jacobian 行列式|Jacobian]] of the map $f:M\to N$. this is the **explicit form**
- Exercise


## Pullback
A map $f : M\to N$ also induces a map

$$f^{\*}: T\_{f(p)}^{\*} N \rightarrow T\_{p}^{\*} M$$

Note that $f\_\*$ goes in the same direction as $f$ ($M\to N$), but $f^*$ goes backward ($N\to M$), hence the name **pullback**. 

If we take $V \in T\_pM$ and $\omega \in T^∗\_{f (p)}N$, the pullback of $\omega$ by $f^∗$ is defined by
$$\left\langle f^{\*} \omega, V\right\rangle=\left\langle\omega, f\_{\*} V\right\rangle .$$

The pullback $f^∗$ naturally extends to tensors of type $(0, r )$, $f^∗ : \mathcal T^0\_{r,f(p)}(N)\to \mathcal T^0\_{r,p}(M)$  

see the conclusion in [[Pullback and Pushforward]]

# Submanifolds
> **definition:**  Immersion, submanifold, embedding
> Let $f : M \to N$ be a smooth map and let $\dim M \leqslant \dim N$.
> 1. The map $f$ is called an **immersion** of $M$ into $N$ if $f\_\* : T\_pM → T\_{f (p)}N$ is an injection (one to one), that is rank $f\_\* = \dim M$.
> 
> 2. The map $f$ is called an **embedding** if $f$ is an injection and an immersion. The image $f (M)$ is called a **submanifold** of $N$. \[In practice, $f (M)$ thus defined is diffeomorphic to $M$.]

- remarks ^08ea5f
	- If $f$ is an immersion, ==$f\_∗$ maps $T\_pM$ isomorphically to an m-dimensional== vector subspace of $T\_{f (p)}N$ since rank $f\_∗ = \dim M$
	- If f is an embedding, $M$ is diffeomorphic to $f (M)$.
	- Clearly, an embedding is an immersion although the converse is not necessarily true.
