# Notes on *Geometry, topology, and physics* by *Mikio Nakahara*

This document is a collection of notes we made in 2022 on the book  [*Geometry, topology, and physics*](https://www.amazon.com/Geometry-Topology-Physics-Graduate-Student/dp/0750306068) by [*Mikio Nakahara*](https://www.mikio-nakahara.com/). 

It includes:
