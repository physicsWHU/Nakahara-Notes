# Notes on *Geometry, topology, and physics* by *Mikio Nakahara*

This document is a collection of notes we made in 2022 on the book  [*Geometry, topology, and physics*](https://www.amazon.com/Geometry-Topology-Physics-Graduate-Student/dp/0750306068) by [*Mikio Nakahara*](https://www.mikio-nakahara.com/). 

It includes: 
 - main ideas of the book
 - details of the derivations of some formulas
 - extra information about some subtle topics.

If you find any error or typo, please contact us to make corrections. It would be amazing if you want to improve this note with us. We are looking forward to your insight.
