# 7.4 Levi-Civita connections

The connection of the most interest in Riemann geometry, especially in the application of physics, is of course Levi-Civita connection. In this subsection, we will discuss more details about this connection and the geodesic equation defined in terms of this connection. As the special emphasis paid on ideal in ring theory or normal subgroup in group theory, we usually give special attention to geodesics and curvature in Riemannian manifolds.

## 7.4.1 The fundamental theorem

Recall the definition of the _affine connection_ in Sec. 7.2.2:
$$\begin{align}
    \nabla_X(Y+Z)&=\nabla_X Y+\nabla_X Z\notag\\\\
    \nabla_{(X+Y)}Z&=\nabla_{X}Z+\nabla_Y Z\notag\\\\
    \nabla_{(fX)}Y&=f\nabla_{X}Y\notag\\\\
    \nabla_X (fY)&=X[f]Y+f\nabla_X Y\notag
\end{align}$$

>**Definition (Levi-Civita connection)**: An affine connection $\nabla$ is called a Levi-Civita connection if
>1. It is compatible with the metric $g$, i.e.
>$$\nabla_X\big<Y,Z\big>=X\big<Y,Z\big>=\big<\nabla_XY,Z\big>+\big<Y,\nabla_XZ\big>$$
>2. It is symmetric
>$$\nabla_XY-\nabla_YX-[X,Y]=0$$
>The Levi-Civita connection defined from above is unique for given (pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds.

**Proof of the uniqueness**: From condition 1 in the definition
$$\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x^k}=\Gamma_{ki}^lg_{li}+\Gamma_{kj}^lg_{il}$$
Rotate the subscripts and we will have (where the torsion-free condition is applied)
$$\Gamma_{ij}^k=\frac{1}{2}g^{kl}\left(\partial_jg_{li}+\partial_ig_{lj}-\partial_lg_{ij}\right)$$


## 7.4.3 Geodesics

In terms of the Levi-Civita connections, we are able to give geodesics as both the "straightest possible" and "shortest possible" curve between two points.

First let us introduce the idea of length in curved space before discussing about the "shortest possible" curve.

>**Definition (proper length)**: The (proper) length of a path $c$ connecting two points $p$ and $q$ is 
>$$I(c)=\int_c\mathrm{d}s=\int_c\sqrt{g_{\mu\nu}\dot{x}^{\mu}\dot{x}^\nu}\mathrm{d}s$$
>where $\dot{x}^\mu=\mathrm{d}x^\mu/\mathrm{d}s$. We can check that this quantity is actually coordinate-independent.

We now give two different definitions of the geodesics and later show that they actually coincide under Levi-Civita connection.

>**Straightest possible curve**: As we have seen in Sec. 7.2.3, given a curve $c(t), t\in I$ on $M$ and its tangent vector $V(t)$, $c(t)$ is a geodesic only when
>$$\nabla_VV=0, \quad\forall t\in I$$
>which gives
>$$\frac{\mathrm{d}^2c^\mu(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2}+\Gamma_{\nu\lambda}^\mu\frac{\mathrm{d}c^\nu}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\mathrm{d}c^\lambda}{\mathrm{d}t}=0$$

>**Shortest possible curve**: As the definition of the proper length shows, we can take the variation of the length to be zero (Euler-Lagrange equation). Here a little trick is applied to simplifed the calculation.



## 7.4.4 The normal coordinate system

>**Definition (exponential map)**: Define a map EXP$:T_pM\to M; X_q\to q$. I.e.
>$$\varphi(\text{EXP}X_q^\mu e_\mu)=X_q^\mu$$
>where $X_q^\mu$ is the _normal coordinate system_.

Give a geodesic $c(t)$ in the Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, satisfying
$$c(0)=p,\quad \left.\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right\vert_p=X=X^\mu e_\mu\in T_pM$$
where $e_\mu$ is the coordinate basis at $p$. Since there is only one unique geodesic $c(q)$ satisfying $c_q(1)=q$. Define the tangent vector at $q$ as $X_q=X_q^\mu e_\mu\in T_pM$. Here $\varphi:q\to X_q^\mu$ is defined to be a coordinate system in the neighborhood of $p$, which is called the _normal coordinate system_ based on $p$. Thus, a geodesic $c(t)$ satisfying $c(0)=p$ and $c(1)=q$ has the coordinate presentation
$$\varphi(c(t))=x^\mu=X_q^\mu t$$
where $X_q^\mu$ is the normal cooredinates of $q$.

In terms of Levi-Civita connection, where the geodesic equation has been given before, the geodesic equation under normal coordinate system is
$$\Gamma_{\nu\lambda}^\mu(X_q^\kappa t)X_q^\nu X_q^\lambda=0$$
which implies that the Christoffel symbol locally vanishes at $p$.

## 7.4.5 Riemann curvature tensor with Levi-Civita connection

Before going into the derivation of the properties of the Riemann curvature with Levi-Civita connection, first let us introduce some familiar metrics, calculation of whose curvature will be of great help in understanding Riemann curvature.

1. Spherical metric:$$g=\mathrm{d}r^2+r^2\mathrm{d}\Omega_2^2\equiv \mathrm{d}r^2+r^2(\mathrm{d}\theta^2+\sin^2\theta\mathrm{d}\phi^2)$$
which describes the manifold $\mathbb{R}^3,\delta)$.
2. Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric:$$\mathrm{d}s^2=-\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)\mathrm{d}t^2+a(t)^2\left(\frac{1}{1-kr^2}\mathrm{d}r^2+r^2\mathrm{d}\Omega_2^2\right)$$ where $k$ can be chosen from -1,0 or 1.
3. Schwarzschild metric $$\mathrm{d}s^2=-f(r)\mathrm{d}t^2+\frac{1}{f(r)}\mathrm{d}r^2+r^2\mathrm{d}\Omega_2^2,\quad f(r)=1-\frac{2M}{r}$$

>**Theorem (Bianchi identities)**: The first and second Bianchi identities for Riemann curvature tensor with Levi-Civita connection read
>$$R(X,Y)Z+R(Y,Z)X+R(Z,X)Y=0$$
>$$(\nabla_XR)(Y,Z)+(\nabla_ZR)(X,Y)+(\nabla_YR)(Z,X)=0$$

**Proof**: Since we need to prove linear equations of a tensor, what we need to do is actually prove those equations for each of its component. Set $X,Y,Z$ to be three basis vectors (not necessary different). Then we have
$$R(X,Y)\equiv \nabla_X\nabla_Y-\nabla_Y\nabla_X$$
and
$$T(X,Y)\equiv \nabla_XY-\nabla_YX-\[X,Y\]=0,\Longrightarrow \nabla_XY=\nabla_YX$$
Then
$$R(X,Y)Z+R(Y,Z)X+R(Z,X)Y=\nabla_X\nabla_YZ+\nabla_Y\nabla_ZX+\nabla_Z\nabla_XY-\nabla_Y\nabla_XZ-\nabla_Z\nabla_YX-\nabla_X\nabla_ZY=0$$
As for the second identity, note that
$$\nabla_X(R(Y,Z)V)=(\nabla_XR)(Y,Z)V+R(\nabla_XY,Z)V+R(Y,\nabla_XZ)V+R(Y,Z)\nabla_XV$$

Our proof above actually yields an equivalent form of Bianchi identities
$$R^\kappa_{\lambda\mu\nu}+R^\kappa_{\mu\nu\lambda}+R_{\nu\lambda\mu}^\kappa=0,\quad (\nabla_\kappa R)^\xi_{\lambda\mu\nu}+(\nabla_\mu R)^\xi_{\lambda\nu\kappa}+(\nabla_\nu R)^\xi_{\lambda\kappa\mu}=0$$
Contraction of $\xi,\mu$ and $\lambda,\nu$ in the second Bianchi identity respectively gives the equation
$$\nabla_\mu G^{\mu\nu}\equiv \nabla_\mu\left(Ric^{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}\mathcal{R}\right)=0$$


Independent component number of Riemann curvature tensor. 
1. Symmetry of Riemann curvature: $R_{\kappa\lambda\mu\nu}=-R_{\lambda\kappa\nu\mu}$ and $R_{\kappa\lambda\mu\nu}=R_{\lambda\kappa\mu\nu}$.
2. The first Bianchi identity: the degree of freedom of the Riemann curvature tensor $F(m)=\frac{1}{12}m^2(m^2-1)$.
