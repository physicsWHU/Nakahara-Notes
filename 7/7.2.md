## 7.2.1 Heuristic introduction

We want to compare vectors defined on different points on the manifold.

Before we compare two vectors defined at different points, we have to "move" a vector defined at one place to another without "changing" it (**parallel transport**). So it's necessary to specify the rules of the parallel transport, which requires an extra structure called **connection**.

---
Let $\widetilde{V} \vert_{x+\Delta x}$ denote a vector $V|_{x}$ parallel transported $x+\Delta x$. Heuristically, We demand that the components satisfy
$$\begin{align}
    \widetilde{V}^\mu(x+\Delta x)-V^\mu(x)&\propto\Delta x\notag\\\\
    \widetilde{(V^\mu+W^\mu)}(x+\Delta x)&=\widetilde{V}^\mu(x+\Delta x)+\widetilde{W}^\mu(x+\Delta x).\notag
\end{align}$$
These conditions are satisfied if we take

$$\widetilde{V}^\mu(x+\Delta x)=V^\mu(x)-V^\lambda(x)\Gamma^{\mu}_{\nu\lambda}\Delta x^\nu$$

There are many distinct rules of parallel transport possible, one for each choice of $\Gamma$. 

---
If the manifold is endowed with a metric, there exists a preferred choice of $\Gamma$, called the **Levi-Civita connection**.

Levi-Civita connection satisfies
1. $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu} = \\Gamma _{\nu\mu}^{\lambda}$
2. the norm of a vector is invariant under parallel transport.

## 7.2.2 Affine connections

>**Definition 7.2** An **affine connection** $\nabla$ is a map $\nabla: \chi(M)\times\chi(M)\to\chi(M)$, or $(X,Y)\mapsto\nabla_X Y$ which satisfies the following conditions:
$$\begin{align}
    \nabla_X(Y+Z)&=\nabla_X Y+\nabla_X Z\notag\\\\
    \nabla_{(X+Y)}Z&=\nabla_{X}Z+\nabla_Y Z\notag\\\\
    \nabla_{(fX)}Y&=f\nabla_{X}Y\notag\\\\
    \nabla_X (fY)&=X[f]Y+f\nabla_X Y\notag
\end{align}$$
where $f\in\mathcal{F}(M)$ and $X,Y,Z\in\chi(M)$.

Take a chart $(U,\phi)$ with the coordinate $x=\phi(p)$ on $M$, and define $m^3$ functions $\Gamma_{\nu\mu}^{\lambda}$ called the **connection coefficients** by
$$\nabla_\nu e_\mu\equiv\nabla_{e_\nu}e_\mu=e_\lambda\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\nu\mu}$$
where $\\{e_\mu\\}=\\{\partial/\partial x^\mu\\}$ is the coordinate basis in $T_p M$.

Let $V=V^\mu e_\mu$ and $W=W^\nu e_\nu$ be elements of $T_p(M)$. Then
$$\nabla_V W=V^\mu\left(\frac{\partial W^\lambda}{\partial x^\mu}+W^\nu \Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\nu}\right)e_\lambda.$$
We can see that the components of $\nabla_VW$ do not depend on the derivative of components of $V$ namely $\frac{\partial V^\lambda}{\partial x^\mu}$, so $\nabla_V W$ can be seen to be a generalization of directional derivative to tensors.

## 7.2.3 Parallel transport and geodesics

Let $c:(a,b)\to M$ be a curve in $M$. 
For simplicity, we assume the image is covered by a single chart $(U,\phi)$ whose coordinate is $x = \phi(p)$.
Let $X$ be a vector field defined (at least) along $c(t)$,
$$X\vert_{c(t)}=X^\mu(c(t))e_\mu\vert_{c(t)}$$
where $e_\mu=\partial/\partial x^\mu$. If $X$ satisfies the condition 
$$\nabla_V X=0\quad \text{for any }t \in(a,b), $$
$X$ is said to be **parallel** transported along $c(t)$ where $V=\text{d}/\text{d}t=(\text{d}x^\mu(c(t))/\text{d}t)e_\mu\vert_{c(t)}$ is the tangent vector to $c(t)$. This condition can also be written as
$$\frac{\text{d}X^\mu}{\text{d}t}+\Gamma^\mu_{\nu\lambda}\frac{\text{d}x^\nu(c(t))}{\text{d}t}X^\lambda=0.$$

---
If the tangent vector $V(t)$ itself is parallel transported along $c(t)$, namely if
$$\nabla_V V=0$$
or
$$\frac{\text{d}^2 x^\mu}{\text{d}t^2}+\Gamma^\mu_{\nu\lambda}\frac{\text{d}x^\nu}{\text{d}t}\frac{\text{d}x^\lambda}{\text{d}t}=0,$$
where $\\{x^\mu\\}$ are the coordinates of $c(t)$, the curve $c(t)$ is called a **geodesic**.

Heuristically, geodesics are the straightest possible curves in a Riemannian manifold.

---
Whether a curve is a geodesic depends on the parametrization. If a curve satisfies
$$\nabla_V V=fV,$$
where $f\in\mathcal{M}$. We can perform a reparametrization $t\to t'$, the component of the tangent vector changes as
$$\frac{\text{d}x^\mu}{\text{d}t}\to\frac{\text{d}t}{\text{d}t'}\frac{\text{d}x^\mu}{\text{d}t}$$
and if $t'$ satisfies
$$\frac{\text{d}^2t'}{\text{d}t^2}=f\frac{\text{d}t'}{\text{d}t},$$
we will again have $\nabla_VV=0$. 
## 7.2.4 The covariant derivative of tensor fields
Since $\nabla_X$ has the meaning of a derivative, it is natural to define the covariant derivative of $f\in\mathcal{F}(M)$ by the ordinary directional derivative:
$$\nabla_X f\equiv X[f].$$
With this definition, we have the Leibnitz rule $\nabla_X(fY)=(\nabla_Xf)Y+f\nabla_XY$.

We require that this be true for any cartesian product of tensors,
$$\nabla_X(T_1\otimes T_2)\equiv(\nabla_X T_1)\otimes T_2+T_1\otimes (\nabla_X T_2)$$
where $T_1$ and $T_2$ are tensor fields of arbitrary types.

We also require that contraction and the action of $\nabla_V$ is interchangeable, namely 
$$\nabla_a(v^b \omega_b)=\nabla_a(\text{C}(v^b\omega_c))=\text{C}\nabla_a(v^b\omega_c)=\text{C}((\nabla_av^b)\omega_c+v^b(\nabla_a\omega_c))=(\nabla_av^b)\omega_b+v^b(\nabla_a\omega_b).$$
 (we denote the action of contraction of $b$ and $c$ indicies by $\text{C}$. See the [Short introduction to abstract index](#short-introduction-to-abstract-index) in the end).

 With these requirements, now we can compute the covariant derivative of a one-form $\omega\in\Omega^1(M)$. Since $\langle\omega,Y\rangle\in\mathcal{F}(M)$ for $Y\in\chi(M)$, we have
 $$X[\langle\omega,Y\rangle]=\nabla_X[\langle\omega,Y\rangle]=\langle\nabla_X\omega,Y\rangle+\langle\omega,\nabla_X Y\rangle.$$
 Writing down both sides in terms of the components we find
 $$(\nabla_X\omega)\_{\nu}=X^\mu\partial_\mu\omega_\nu-X^\mu \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu} \omega_\lambda$$

 A generalization:
 $$\begin{align}
     \nabla_\nu t^{\lambda_1\dots\lambda\_p}\_{\mu_1\dots\mu_q}=&\partial\_{\nu}t^{\lambda\_1\dots\lambda\_p}\_{\mu\_1\dots\mu\_q}+\Gamma^{\lambda\_1}\_{\nu\kappa}t^{\kappa\lambda\_2\dots\lambda\_p}\_{\mu\_1\dots\mu\_q}+\dots\\\\
     &+\Gamma^{\lambda\_p}\_{\nu\kappa}t^{\lambda\_1\dots\lambda\_{p-1}\kappa}\_{\mu\_1\dots\mu\_q}-\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{\nu\mu\_1}t^{\lambda\_1\dots\lambda\_p}\_{\kappa\mu\_2\dots\mu\_q}-\dots\\\\
     &-\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{\nu\mu\_q}t^{\lambda\_1\dots\lambda\_p}\_{\mu\_1\dots\mu\_{q-1}\kappa}.
 \end{align}$$
## 7.2.5 The transformation properties of connection coefficients
Introduce another chart $(V,\phi)$ such that $U\cap V= \emptyset$, whose coordinates are $y = \phi(p)$. Let $\\{e_\mu\\} = \\{\partial/\partial x^\mu\\}$ and $\\{ f_\alpha\\} = \\{\partial/\partial y^\alpha\\}$ be bases of the respective coordinates. Denote the connection coefficients with respect to the $y$-coordinates by $\widetilde{\Gamma}^{\alpha}\_{\beta\gamma}$. The basis vector $f\_\alpha$ satisfies
$$\nabla\_{f\_\alpha}=\widetilde{\Gamma}^\gamma\_{\alpha\beta}f\_{\gamma}.$$
Using $f_\alpha=(\partial x^\mu/\partial y^\alpha)e_\mu$, we have
$$\nabla\_{f\_\alpha}f\_\beta=\nabla\_{f\_\alpha}\left(\frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial y^\beta}e\_\mu\right)=\left(\frac{\partial^2 x^\nu}{\partial y^\alpha \partial y^\beta}+\frac{\partial x^\lambda}{\partial y^\alpha}\frac{\partial x^\mu}{\partial y^\beta}\Gamma^{\nu}_{\lambda\mu}\right)$$
## 7.2.6 The metric connection
If the manifold is endowed with a metric, then we can fix the connection $\Gamma$.

We demand that the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ be covariantly constant, that is, if two vectors $X$ and $Y$ are parallel transported along any curve, then the inner product between them remains constant under parallel transport. 
Let $V$ be a tangent vector to an arbitrary curve along which the vectors are parallel transported. Then we have
$$\begin{align}
0=&\nabla_V[g_{ab}X^{a}Y^{b})]=V^{c}[(\nabla_c)X^a Y^b+g_{ab} (\nabla_c X^a) Y^b+g_{ab} X^a(\nabla_c Y^b) ]\\\\
&V^c X^a Y^b (\nabla_c g_{ab}).
\end{align}$$
Since this is true for any curves and vectors, we must have
$$\nabla_c g_{ab}=0$$ or $$\partial\_\lambda g\_{\mu\nu}-\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{\lambda\mu}g\_{\kappa\nu}-\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{\lambda\nu}g\_{\kappa\nu}=0.$$
If this is satisfied, the affine connection $\nabla$ is said to be **metric compatible** or simply a **metric connection**.

From now on, we will deal with metric connections only.

---
Cyclic permutations of $(\lambda, \mu, \nu)$ yield
$$\begin{align}
    \partial\_\lambda g\_{\mu\nu}-\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{\lambda\mu}g\_{\kappa\nu}-\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{\lambda\nu}g\_{\kappa\nu}&=0\notag\\\\
    \partial\_\nu g\_{\lambda\mu}-\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{\mu\lambda}g\_{\kappa\mu}-\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{\nu\mu}g\_{\kappa\lambda}&=0\notag\\\\
    \partial\_\mu g\_{\nu\lambda}-\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{\mu\nu}g\_{\kappa\lambda}-\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{\nu\mu}g\_{\kappa\lambda}&=0.\notag
\end{align}$$
Then we have:
$$-\partial\_\lambda g\_{\mu\nu}+\partial\_\nu g\_{\lambda\mu}+\partial\_\mu g\_{\nu\lambda}+T^\kappa_{\lambda\mu}g\_{\kappa\nu}+T^{\kappa}\_{\lambda\nu}g\_{\kappa\mu}-2\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{(\mu\nu)}g\_{\kappa\lambda}=0$$
where $T^{\kappa}\_{\lambda\mu}\equiv2\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{[\lambda\mu]}\equiv\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{\lambda\mu}-\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{\mu\lambda}$ and $\Gamma^\kappa\_{(\mu\nu)}\equiv\frac{1}{2}(\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{\nu\mu}+\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{\mu\nu})$. The tensor $T^{\kappa}\_{\lambda\mu}$ is anti-symmetric with respect to the lower indices and called the **torsion tensor**. 

We also have
$$\Gamma^{\kappa}\_{(\mu\nu)}=+\frac{1}{2}(T^{\kappa}\_{\nu\mu}+T^{\kappa}\_{\mu\nu}).$$


## Short introduction to abstract index
Let $v\in T_p(M)$ and $\omega\in T^*_p(M)$, we denote $v\otimes\omega$ by $v^a\omega_b$ and $a$, $b$ here are **abstract indices**.
We use abstract indices to denote tensors and at the same time indicate the type of the tensors without referring to the components of them.

- Latin letters are used to denote the abstract indices and Greek letters the components of tensors. 
- For vectors, we use upper indices $v^a$. For dual vectors, we use down indices $\omega_b$.
  $$T_{b_1\dots b_m}^{a_1\dots a_m}\equiv T_{\nu_1\dots\nu_n}^{\mu_1\dots\mu_m}e_{\mu_1}\otimes\dots\otimes e_{\mu_m}\otimes e^{\nu_1}\otimes\dots\otimes e^{\nu_n}$$
- Repeated indices indicate contraction $v^a \omega_a\equiv v^\mu \omega_\mu$. For example,
  $$T^{abc}_{acde}=T(e^\mu,\cdot,e^\nu;e_\mu,e_\nu,\cdot,\cdot)$$
