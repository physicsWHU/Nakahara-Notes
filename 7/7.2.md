## 7.2.1 Heuristic introduction

We want to compare vectors defined on different points on the manifold.

Before we compare two vectors defined at different points, we have to "move" a vector defined at one place to another without "changing" it (**parallel transport**). So it's necessary to specify the rules of the parallel transport, which requires an extra structure called **connection**.

---
Let $\widetilde{V} \vert_{x+\Delta x}$ denote a vector $V|_{x}$ parallel transported $x+\Delta x$. Heuristically, We demand that the components satisfy
$$\begin{align}
    \widetilde{V}^\mu(x+\Delta x)-V^\mu(x)&\propto\Delta x\notag\\\\
    \widetilde{(V^\mu+W^\mu)}(x+\Delta x)&=\widetilde{V}^\mu(x+\Delta x)+\widetilde{W}^\mu(x+\Delta x).\notag
\end{align}$$
These conditions are satisfied if we take

$$\widetilde{V}^\mu(x+\Delta x)=V^\mu(x)-V^\lambda(x)\Gamma^{\mu}_{\nu\lambda}\Delta x^\nu$$

There are many distinct rules of parallel transport possible, one for each choice of $\Gamma$. 

---
If the manifold is endowed with a metric, there exists a preferred choice of $\Gamma$, called the **Levi-Civita connection**.

Levi-Civita connection satisfies
1. $\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu} = \\Gamma _{\nu\mu}^{\lambda}$
2. the norm of a vector is invariant under parallel transport.

## 7.2.2 Affine connections

>**Definition 7.2** An **affine connection** $\nabla$ is a map $\nabla: \chi(M)\times\chi(M)\to\chi(M)$, or $(X,Y)\mapsto\nabla_X Y$ which satisfies the following conditions:
$$\begin{align}
    \nabla_X(Y+Z)&=\nabla_X Y+\nabla_X Z\notag\\\\
    \nabla_{(X+Y)}Z&=\nabla_{X}Z+\nabla_Y Z\notag\\\\
    \nabla_{(fX)}Y&=f\nabla_{X}Y\notag\\\\
    \nabla_X (fY)&=X[f]Y+f\nabla_X Y\notag
\end{align}$$
where $f\in\mathcal{F}(M)$ and $X,Y,Z\in\chi(M)$.

Take a chart $(U,\phi)$ with the coordinate $x=\phi(p)$ on $M$, and define $m^3$ functions $\Gamma_{\nu\mu}^{\lambda}$ called the **connection coefficients** by
$$\nabla_\nu e_\mu\equiv\nabla_{e_\nu}e_\mu=e_\lambda\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\nu\mu}$$
where $\\{e_\mu\\}=\\{\partial/\partial x^\mu\\}$ is the coordinate basis in $T_p M$.

Let $V=V^\mu e_\mu$ and $W=W^\nu e_\nu$ be elements of $T_p(M)$. Then
$$\nabla_V W=V^\mu\left(\frac{\partial W^\lambda}{\partial x^\mu}+W^\nu \Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\nu}\right)e_\lambda$$

## 7.2.3 Parallel transport and geodesics

Let $c:(a,b)\to M$ be a curve in $M$. 
For simplicity, we assume the image is covered by a single chart $(U,\phi)$ whose coordinate is $x = \phi(p)$.
Let $X$ be a vector field defined (at least) along $c(t)$,
$$X\vert_{c(t)}=X^\mu(c(t))e_\mu\vert_{c(t)}$$
where $e_\mu=\partial/\partial x^\mu$. If $X$ satisfies the condition 
$$\nabla_V X=0\quad \text{for any }t \in(a,b), $$
$X$ is said to be parallel transported along $c(t)$ where $V=\text{d}/\text{d}t=(\text{d}x^\mu(c(t))/\text{d}t)e_\mu\vert_{c(t)}$ is the tangent vector to $c(t)$. This condition can also be written as
$$\frac{\text{d}X^\mu}{\text{d}t}+\Gamma^\mu_{\nu\lambda}\frac{\text{d}x^\nu(c(t))}{\text{d}t}X^\lambda=0$$
