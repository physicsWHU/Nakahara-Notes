# 7.1 Riemannian manifolds and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds


## 7.1.1 Metric tensors


>**Definition 7.1**: Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold. A **Riemannian metric** $g$ on $M$ is a type $(0, 2)$ tensor field on $M$ which satisfies the following axioms at each point $p \in M$:
>1. $g_p(U,V)=g_p(V,U)$
>2. $g_p(U,U)\ge0$, where the equality holds only when $U=0$,
>
>where $U,V\in T_p M$ and $g_p=g|_p$.

A tensor field $g$ of type $(0, 2)$ is a **pseudo-Riemannian metric** if it satisfies
1. $g_p(U,V)=g_p(V,U)$
2. if $g_p(U,V)=0$ for any $U\in T_p M$, then $V=0$.

If there exists a metric $g$, we can define the inner product between two vectors $U, V\in T_pM$ to be $g_p(U,V)$.

It can be seen that $g(U,\ )$ is a map $T_pM\to \mathbb{R}$ by $V\mapsto g_p(U,V)$, which means that it can be identified with a one-form $\omega_U\in T_p^* M$. 

Similarly, $\omega\in T^*_p M$ induces $V_\omega\in T_pM$ by $\langle \omega,U\rangle=g(V_\omega,U)$.

Thus, the metric $g_p$ gives rise to an isomorphism between $T_pM$ and $T^*_pM$.

---
Let $(U,\phi)$ be a chart in $M$ and $\{x^\mu\}$ the coordinates. We can expand $g_p$ as:
$$g_p=g_{\mu\nu}(p)\text{d}x^\mu\otimes\text{d}x^\nu$$
and
$$g_{\mu\nu}(p)=g_p\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu},\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\nu}\right) \quad (p\in M).$$

---
Subscript in $g_p$ is usually omitted. It is common to regard $g_{\mu\nu}$ as a matrix. Since $g_{\mu\nu}$ has maximal rank, we can define its inverse $g^{\mu\nu}$ by $g_{\mu\nu}g^{\nu\lambda}=g^{\lambda\nu}g_{\nu\mu}=\delta^\lambda_\mu$.

We define $g\equiv\det(g_{\mu\nu})$. Clearly, $\det(g^{\mu\nu})=g^{-1}$.

The isomorphism between $T_p M$ and $T^*_p M$ is now expressed as
$$\omega_\mu=g_{\mu\nu},\quad U^\mu=g^{\mu\nu}\omega_\nu.$$

It's a convention to denote a metric in the form of an infinitestimal displacement
$$\text{d}s^2=g(\text{d}x^\mu\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu},\text{d}x^\nu\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\nu})=g_{\mu\nu}\text{d}x^\mu\text{d}x^\nu.$$

---

Since $g^{\mu\nu}$ is a symmetric matrix, the eigenvalues are real. If $g$ is Riemannian, all the eigenvalues are strictly positive and if $g$ is pseudo-Riemannian, some of them may be negative. If there are $i$ positive and $j$ negative eigenvalues, the pair $(i, j)$ is called the index of the metric. If $j = 1$, the metric is called a Lorentz metric.

We can always diagonize and reduce the matrix element of $g$ to $\pm1$ by a change of basis. After this procedure, if we start with a
- Riemannian metric, we end up with the **Euclidean metric** $\delta=\text{diag}(1,\dots,1)$.
- Minkowski metric, we end up with the **Minkowski metric** $\eta=\text{diag}(-1,1,\dots,1)$.

If $(M,g)$ is Lorentzian, the elements of $T_p M$ can be devided into
1. $g(U,U)\gt0\to U$ is **spacelike**,
2. $g(U,U)=0\to U$ is **lightlike**(or **null**),
3. $g(U,U)\lt0\to U$ is **timelike**.

If a smooth manifold $M$ admits a Riemannian metric $g$, the pair $(M, g)$ is called a **Riemannian manifold**. If $g$ is a pseudo-Riemannian metric, $(M,g)$ is called a **pseudo-Riemannian manifold**. If $g$ is Lorentzian, $(M, g)$ is called a **Lorentz manifold**.

## 7.1.2 Induced metric

Let $M$ be an $m$-dimensional submanifold of an $n$-dimensional Riemanian manifold $N$ with the metric $g_N$. If $f:M\to N$ is the embedding which induces the submanifold structure of $M$, the pullback map $f^*$ induces the natural metric $g_M=f^* g_N$ on $M$ (**induced metric**). The components of $g_M$ are given by
$$g_{M\mu\nu}(x)=g_{N\alpha\beta}(f(x))\frac{\partial f^\alpha}{\partial x^\mu}\frac{\partial f^\beta}{\partial x^\nu}$$
where $f^\alpha$ denote the coordinates of $f(x)$.
