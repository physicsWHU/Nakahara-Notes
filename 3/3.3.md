This chapter focuses on developing an algebraic representation of a topological spaces, originated from the idea of finding topological invariants.

*Some definitions we will soon encounter: 
> $r$-chain group $C_r(K)$, $r$-cycle group $Z_r(K)$, $r$-boundary group $B_r(K)$; homology group $H_r(K)$.

## 3.3.1 Oriented simplexes

## 3.3.2 Chain group, cycle group and boundary group

>**Definition (Chain group)**: Given $I_r$ $r$-simplexes from a simplicial complex $K$ that are *linearly independent*, those simplexes generate a free Abelian group $C_r(K)$ called the **$r$-chain group**, denoted by $C_r(K)$, and the elements of this group are called $r$-chains $c\in C_r(K)$.

>**Tips**: In defining the chain group, we have to choose the simplexes in $K$ as oriented, so that the inverse of an $r$-chain is well defined and is still an $r$-chain.

We can see instantly from the definition that an arbitrary element $c\in C_r(K)$ can be written as the linear combination of the generators, i.e. 
$$c=\sum_{i=1}^{I_r}c_i \sigma_{r,i}, \quad c_i\in \mathbb{Z}$$
where $\sigma_{r,i}$ denotes for the generators.

>**Q**: Is an $r$-chain a simplex?

>**Definition (Boundary operator)**: An operator $\partial_r$ acting on an $r$-simplex $\sigma_r$ is defined as
>$$\partial_r\sigma_r\equiv\sum_{i=0}^r(-1)^i(p_0 p_1\cdots\hat{p}_i\cdots p_r)$$
>where $\hat{p}_i$ means that the $i$-th element is emitted.

## 3.3.4 Computation of $H_{0}(K)$

>**Theorem 3.5.** Let $K$ be a connected simplicial complex. Then
>$$H_0 (K)\cong\mathbb{Z}$$
>
>**Proof** 
>$$\begin{align}[z]=\left[\sum_i n_i p_i\right]&=\sum_i n_i [p_i]=\sum_i n_i [p_1]\\&=\left[\left(\sum_i n_i\right)p_1\right] \end{align}$$
>If $\sum_i n_i=0$, then $[z]=[0]\Rightarrow z\sim0\Rightarrow z-0=z\in B_0 \left(K\right)$, namely (May be a typo here on the book)

## Questions

>**Question 1**
>In the **Definition 3.5.**, we see the $r$th homology group is defined by $H_{r}(K)\equiv Z_{r}(K)/B_{r}(K)$. But from the definition of [quotient group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_group), if the quotient space $H_{r}(K)$ can be called "a group", $B_{r}(K)$ has to be a [normal subgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_subgroup). How to prove it?
