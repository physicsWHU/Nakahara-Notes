## Questions

>**Question 1**
>In the **Definition 3.5.**, we see the $r$th homology group is defined by $H_{r}(K)\equiv Z_{r}(K)/B_{r}(K)$. But from the definition of [quotient group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_group), if the quotient space $H_{r}(K)$ can be called "a group", $B_{r}(K)$ has to be a [normal subgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_subgroup). How to ptove it?
