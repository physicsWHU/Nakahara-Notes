# Problems
In this document, we will discuss after-class exercises and some difficult exercises one by one, and give the analysis. We will continue to update you on issues that we haven't solved yet.
# Problem 1:
>Show that the 4g-gon in figure 2.13(a), with the boundary identified,represents the torus with genus g of figure 2.13(b). The reader may use equation$T^2#T^2#\cdot\cdot\cdot #T^2=\Sigama_g$
# Answer 1:
>processing
# Problem 2:
>Let $X={1,\frac{1}{2},...\frac{1}{n},...}$ be a subset of R. Show that X is not closed in R. Show that $Y={1,\frac{1}{2},...,\frac{1}{n},...,0}$ is closed in R, hence compact.
# Answer 2:
> We already know that the intersection of any number of closed sets is a closed set, and maybe we can prove that by converting the union of infinite closed sets into the intersection of known closed sets or open sets
# Problem 3:
>Show that two figures in figure 2.10(b) are homeomorphic to each other. Find how to unlink the right figure in $R^4$
# Answer 3:
>One is to show that the two figures are homeomorphic. This is trivial: just take a homeomorphism from one ring on the left to one ring on the right and an homeomorphism from the other ring on the left to the other ring on the right. Combine those two homeomorphism to a map from the two rings on the left to the two rings on the right; that's an homeomorphism as well. It is important to realize that the ambient space (the R3) doesn't play a role!
>The other question is to argue that there is a homotopy $[0,1]\times(S_1\cup S_2)\rightarrow R^4$
# Problem 4:
>Show that there are only five regular polyhedra: a tetrahedron, a hexahedron, an octahedron, a dodecahedron and an icosahedron. [Hint: Use Eulerâ€™s theorem.]
# Answer 4:
>For any polyhedron, we have V vertices, F faces, and E edges. Let each face of a regular polyhedron be a positive n-sided, and each vertex has m edges, so the number of edges satisfies:
$$E=\frac{1}{2}nF$$ And E is half the product of V vertices with m:$$E=\frac{1}{2}mV$$.Then we use Euler theorem:$$\frac{2E}{m}+\frac{2E}{n}-E=2$$ After that we get:$$\frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n}=\frac{1}{E}+\frac{1}{2}$$
where E is $\mathbb{N}^*$.
