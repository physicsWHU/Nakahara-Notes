# Problems
In this document, we will discuss after-class exercises and some difficult exercises one by one, and give the analysis. We will continue to update you on issues that we haven't solved yet.
# Problem 1:
>Show that the 4g-gon in figure 2.13(a), with the boundary identified,represents the torus with genus g of figure 2.13(b). The reader may use equation$T^2#T^2#\cdot\cdot\cdot #T^2=\Sigama_g$
# Answer 1:
>processing
# Problem 2:
>Let $X={1,\frac{1}{2},...\frac{1}{n},...}$ be a subset of R. Show that X is not closed in R. Show that $Y={1,\frac{1}{2},...,\frac{1}{n},...,0}$ is closed in R, hence compact.
# Answer 2:
> We already know that the intersection of any number of closed sets is a closed set, and maybe we can prove that by converting the union of infinite closed sets into the intersection of known closed sets or open sets
