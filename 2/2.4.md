## 2.4.1 Homeomorphisms
The purpose of topology is to classify spaces. 
For example, in elementary geometry, the equivalence of figures is given by congruence, which turns out to be too stringent for our purpose.
In topolgy, we define two figures to be equivalent if it is possible to deform one figure into the other by *continuous deformation*.
> 
> **Definition 2.9** : Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be topological spaces. A map $f : X_{1}\rightarrow X_{2}$ is a **homeomorphism** if it is continuous and has an inverse $f^{-1}:X_{2}\rightarrow X_{1}$ which is also continuous. If there exists a homoemorphism between $X_1$ and $X_2$ , $X_1$ is said to be **homoemorphic** to $X_2$ and vice versa.

A homeomorphism is an equivalence relation and the proof is:

>Simply choose $f=\text{id}_X$.
>
>**Symmetry**
>
>By definition, if $f : X_1 \rightarrow X_2$ is a homeomorphism, so is $f^{-1} : X_2 \rightarrow X_1$. (Using $(f^{-1})^{-1}=f$)
>
>**Transitivity**
>
>If $f : X_1 \rightarrow X_2$ and $g : X_2 \rightarrow X_3$ are homeomorphisms, so is $g\circ f : X_1\rightarrow X_3$.$$\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$$


Intuitively speaking, two topological spaces are homeomorphicto each other if we can deform one into the other continuously, that is, without tearing them apart or pasting.

## 2.4.2 Topological invariants

**Topological invariants** are quantities to characterize equivalence clsses of homeomorphism.


If two spaces are homeomorphic to each other,they have the same "topological invariants". And if two spaces have different "topological invariants",they are not homeomorphic to each other.


Here are some representative examples:

**Compactness**

Hello!

**Connectedness**

Bonjour!


**Boundness (<mark>is not</mark>)**

Ciao!


Pay additional attention to the following case:
An open disc  $D^2=  \left\\{ (x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}|x^2+y^2<1 \right\\}$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$ when we choose 
$$f(x,y)=\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}},\frac{y}{1-x^2-y^2}\right)$$
Previously, we found a closed disk whose boundary $S^1$ corresponding to a point is homeomorphic to $S^2$. In other words, we will get a compact space $S^2$ after adding an infinity point to $\mathbb{R}^2$. We can summarize the relation by the following figure:

## 2.4.3 Homotomy type

The condition of  homeomorphism is too restrict, we will see it would be usefl to define a new equivalent class, namely "of the *same homotopy type*".

Just relax the condition in **Definition 2.9** so that the continuous functions $f$ and $g$ need not have inverses.

## 2.4.4 Euler characteristic: an example
In this section, We focus on $\mathbb{R}^3$. 
> **Definition 2.10** : Let $X$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$, which is homeomorphic to a polyderon $K$. Then the **Euler characteristic** $\chi(X)$ of $X$ is defined by
> $$\begin{align}
\chi(X)=&\text{(number of verticies in}\ K)-\text{(number of edges in}\ K)\\\\
&+\text{(number of faces in}\ K)
\end{align}$$ 

> **Theorem 2.4 (PoincarÃ©-Alexander)**: The Euler characteristic $\chi(X)$ is idependent of the polyhedron $K$ as long as $K$ is homeomorphic to $X$

The *connected sum* $X \sharp Y$ of two surfaces $X$ and $Y$ is a surface obtained by removing a small disc from each $X$ and $Y$ and connecting the resulting holes with a cylinder.
![connected sum](https://gitee.com/spaceofzsj/pictures/raw/master/20220226130653.png)

It is obvious that $ S^{2} \sharp X=X $ and $T^{2}\sharp T^{2}$. An immediate generalization is $\underbrace{T^{2}\sharp T^{2}\sharp\cdots\sharp T^{2}}_{g\ \text{factors}}=\Sigma_g$



> **Theorem 2.5** : Let $X$ and $Y$ be two surfaces. Then the Euler characteristic of the connected sum $X\sharp Y$ is given by
> $$\chi(X\sharp Y)=\chi(X)+\chi(Y)-2.$$
>
>**Proof**





> **Theorem 2.6** : Let $X$ and $Y$ be two figures in $\mathbb{R}^3$. If $X$ is homeomorphic to $Y$, then $\chi(X)=\chi(Y)$. In other words, if $\chi(X)\neq\chi(Y)$, $X$ cannot be homeomorphic to $Y$.

While compactness and connectedness are geometrical properties of a figure or a space $X$, the Euler characteristic is a integer $\chi(X)\in\mathbb{Z}$, which is algebraic. It implies that the Euler characteristic can relate geometry to algebra. We may compute the Euler characteristic of a smooth surface by [*Gauss-Bonnet theorem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Bonnet_theorem?oldformat=true)(see chapter 12).
