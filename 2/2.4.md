## 2.4.1 Homeomorphisms

In topolgy, we define two figures to be equivalent if it is possible to deform one figure into the other by *continuous deformation*.
>*Definition 2.9*: Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be topological spaces. A map $f : X_{1}\rightarrow X_{2}$ is a **homeomorphism** if it is continuous and has an inverse $f^{-1}:X_{2}\rightarrow X_{1}$ which is also continuous. If there exists a homoemorphism between $X_1$ and $X_2$ , $X_1$ is said to be **homoemorphic** to $X_2$ and vice versa.
