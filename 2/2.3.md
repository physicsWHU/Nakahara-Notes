> **Definition 2.8**: 
> 1. A topological space $X$ is **connected** if it cannot be written as $X=X_1 \cup X_2$, where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are both open and $X_1\cap X_2=\emptyset$. Otherwise $X$ is called **disconnected**.
> 2. A topological space $X$ is called **arcwise connected** if, for any points $x$, $y\in X$, there exists a continuous map $f : [0,1]\rightarrow X$ such that $f(0)=x$ and $f(1)=y$. With a few pathological exceptions, arcwise connectedness is practically equivalent to connectedness.
> 3. A **loop** in a topological space $X$ is a continuous map $f : [0,1]\rightarrow X$ such that $f(0)=f(1)$. If any loop in $X$ can be continuously shrunk to a point, $X$ is called **simply connected**
