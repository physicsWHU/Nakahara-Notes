# 4.6 General Proerties
## 4.6.1 Abelian nature of higher homotopy groups
Higher homotopy groups are always Abelian. For any n-loops $\alpha$ and $\beta$ at $x_0\in X$, $[\alpha]$ and $[\beta]$ satisfy
$$[\alpha]\*[\beta]=[\beta]\*[\alpha]$$

## 4.6.2 Arcwise connectness 
If $X$ is arcwise connected, the base point need not be specified.
If a topological space $X$ is arcwise connected, $\pi_n(X, x_0)$ is isomorphic to
$\pi_n(X, x_1)$ for any pair $x_0, x_1 \in X$. 

## 4.6.3 Homotopy invariance of higher homotopy groups
Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces of the same homotopy type. If $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is a homotopy equivalence, the homotopy group $\pi_n(X, x0)$ is isomorphic to $\pi_n(Y, f (x_0))$.

## 4.6.4 Higher homotopy groups of a product space
Let $X$ and $Y$ be arcwise connected topological spaces. Then$$\pi_{n}(X \times Y) \cong \pi_{n}(X) \oplus \pi_{n}(Y)$$
## 4.6.5 Universal Covering Space
> **Definiton 4.12**  (covering space):
> Let $X$ and $\tilde{X}$ be connected topological spaces. The pair $(\tilde{X} , p)$, or simply $\tilde{X}$ , is called the **covering space** of $X$ if there exists a continuous map $p : \tilde{X} \rightarrow X$ such that 
> 1. $p$ is surjective (onto)
> 2. for each $x \in X$, there exists a connected open set $U \subset X$ containing $x$, such that $p^{âˆ’1}(U)$ is a disjoint union of open sets in ($X$ , each of which is mapped homeomorphically onto $U$ by $p$.


> **Theorem 4.10:** Let $(\tilde{X}, p)$ be the universal covering space of a connected topological space $X$. If $x_0 \in X$ and  $\tilde{x_0} \in \tilde{X}$ are base points such that $p(\tilde{x_0}) = x_0$, the induced homomorphism$$p_{*}:\pi_{n}\left(\widetilde{X}, \tilde{x_0}\right) \rightarrow \pi_{n}\left(X, x_{0}\right)$$ is an isomorphism for $n \ge 2$.
