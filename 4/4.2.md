# 4.2 General properties of fundamental groups

## 4.2.1 Arcwise connectedness and fundamental groups

> **Theorem4.2.** Let X be an arcwise connected topological space and let $x_0$, $x_1$$\in$X.Then $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ is isomorphic to $\pi_1(X,x_1)$.
> **Proof** Let $\eta$ :$I\to X$ be a path such that $\eta(0)=x_0$ and $\eta(1)=x_1$. If $\alpha$ is a loop at $x_0$, then ${\eta}^{-1}* \alpha * \eta$ is a loop at $x_1$. Given an element $[\alpha]\in \pi_1(X,x_0)$, this correspondence induces a unique element $[\alpha^{'}]=[\eta^{'}* \alpha* \eta]\in \pi_1(X,x_1)$. We denote this map by $P_{\eta}:\pi_1(X,x_0)\to\pi_1(X,x_1)$ so that $[\alpha^{'}]=P_{\eta}([\alpha])$. 



## 4.2.2 Homotopic invariance of fundamental groups
In the previous section, we defined homotopy relation between loops (or path) and now we can generalize the idea to arbitary maps. Let $f,g : X\rightarrow Y$ be continuous maps. If there exists a continuous map $F : X\times I\rightarrow Y$ such that $F(x,0)=f(x)$ and $F(x,1)=g(x)$, $f$ is said to be **homotopic** to $g$, denoted by $f\sim g$. The map $F$ is called a **homotopy** between $f$ and $g$.
