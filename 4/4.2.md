## 4.2.1 Arcwise connectedness and fundamental groups
Theorem4.2. Let X be an arcwise connected topological space and let $x_0$, $x_1$$\in$X.Then $\pi_1(X,x_0)$ is isomorphic to $\pi_1(X,x_1)$.\\\\
Proof.

## 4.2.2 Homotopic invariance of fundamental groups
In the previous section, we defined homotopy relation between loops (or path) and now we can generalize the idea to arbitary maps. Let $f,g : X\rightarrow Y$ be continuous maps. If there exists a continuous map $F : X\times I\rightarrow Y$ such that $F(x,0)=f(x)$ and $F(x,1)=g(x)$, $f$ is said to be **homotopic** to $g$, denoted by $f\sim g$. The map $F$ is called a **homotopy** between $f$ and $g$.
