# 4.9 Defects in nematic liquid crystals

## 4.9.1 Order parameter of nematic liquid crystals

An example of nematic liquid crystal is *octyloxy-cyanobiphenyl* whose molecule looks like a rod and the order parameter of it is **director** which is given by the average direction of the "rod". 

The director has an inversion symmetry which means we can't distinguish the directors $\vec{n}=\rightarrow$ and $-\vec{n}=\leftarrow$, so the order parameter lives in the **projective plane** $\mathbb{R}P^2$.

The director in general depends on the position $\vec{r}$. Then we may define a map $f:\mathbb{R^3}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}P^2$ and this map is called the **texture**.
## 4.9.2 Line defects in nematic liquid crystals

From the fact that $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}P^2)\cong\mathbb{Z}_2=\{0,1\}$, there exist two kind of line defect in the nematic liquid crystals; one can be continuously deformed into a uniform configuration while the other cannot.

> Comment on the "*continuous deformation*":
> Take $M=\mathbb{R}P^2$ as an example. Denote the initial distribution is A$(\vec{r})$. We say $A(\vec{r})$ can be continuously deformed into  if there exists an *continuous map* $f:\mathbb{R}^3\times I\rightarrow\mathbb{R}P^2$ where $f$ satisfies:
> 1. $f(\vec{r},0)=A(\vec{r})$
> 2. $f(\vec{r},1)=B(\vec{r})$
## 4.9.3 Point defects in nematic liquid crystals

A line defect and a point defect may be (*when the line defect is "closed"*)conbined into a **ring defect**. 

See textbook for a detailed example.

## 4.9.4 Higher dimensional texture

After choosing a *standard director* $\vec{n}_0$, a director $\vec{n}$ at any position can be characterized by a 3-dimensional rotation $R(\vec{e},\alpha)\in\text{SO(3)}$: $\vec{n}=R(\vec{e},\alpha)\vec{n_0}$. 

An arbitrary rotation in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is specified by a unit vector $\vec{e}$, around which the rotation is carried out, and the rotation angle $\alpha$. It is possible to assign a "vector" $\vec{\Omega}=\alpha \vec{e}$ to the rotation. It is not exactly a vector since $\Omega =\pi\vec{e}$ and $−\Omega=−\pi\vec{e}$ are the same rotation and hence should be identified. Therefore, $\vec{\Omega}$ belongs to the real projective space $\mathbb{R}P^3$
