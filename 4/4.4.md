# 4.4 Fundamental groups of polyhedra

In this subsection, we will hopefully develop a systematic way of computing the fundamental groups of triangulable topological space $X$ by considering the fundamental group of the polyhedron $K$ corresponding to it. Some algebraic structure will be introduced first.

>**Definitions in advance**: Free group, relations; edge path, edge loop, edge group, tree.

## Free groups and relations

Recall our definitions of free Abelian group. However, here the modifier "Abelian" is emitted, and we will employ multiplicative notation for the group operation.

>**Definition (Free group)**: A subset $X=\\{x_j\\}$ of group $G$ is called a free set of generators of $G$ if $\forall g\in G-\\{e\\}$ is *uniquely* written as
>$$g=x^{i_1}_1\cdots x^{i_n}_n$$
>where $n$ is finite and $i_k\in \mathbb{Z}$.

Some grammars:
>**Definition (letter, word)**: $G$ is a group whose generators form a set $X$. $x_i\in X$ is called a *letter*, and a *word* is the product of letters 
>$$w=x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}$$
>where $x_j\in X$ and $i_j\in \mathbb{Z}$. If $i_j\neq 0$ and $x_i\neq x_j$, then a word becomes a *reduced word*.

We can check the grammar with several examples.

Along with the empty word 1, we can construct a well-defined free group generated by $X$ denoted by $F[X]$. The multiplication is the juxtaposition of two words followed by reduction.

>**Claim**: A group $G$ is uniquely specified by its generators and a set of *relations*.

>**Definition (relation)**: Let $\\{x_k\\}$ be a set of generators of group $G$, the *relations* are written as 
>$$r=\sum_jx_{k_j}^{i_j}=1$$

Then, there is a natural homomorphism $\phi$ from $F[X]$ onto $G$
$$\phi: x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}\longrightarrow x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}$$
Since we have the fundamental theorem of homomorphism:
$$F[X]/\text{ker} \phi\simeq G$$
which illustrates that a group $G$ can be presented by its generators and relations
$$(x_1,\cdots x_p; r_1, \cdots r_q$$
which is called the presentation of $G$.

## Calculating fundamental groups of polyhedra

We have developed the fundamental group as a very useful topological invariant and further constructed an equivalence relation out of this idea. However, calculating this group seems to be disturbing as shown in previous sections. In this section, we will try to focus on the triangulable spaces, i.e. we can transform the problem into calculating the fundamental groups of polyhedra. Hopefully, we will be able to obtain a systematic method.

Given a triangulable space $X$, and the corresponding polyhedron $|K|$. Then $\pi_1(X)=\pi_1(|K|)$.

>**Definition (edge path)**: 

>**Theorem**: $$E(K;v)\simeq \pi_1(|K|;v)$$.

>**Definition (tree)**:
