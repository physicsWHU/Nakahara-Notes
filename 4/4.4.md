# 4.4 Fundamental groups of polyhedra

In this subsection, we will hopefully develop a systematic way of computing the fundamental groups of triangulable topological space $X$ by considering the fundamental group of the polyhedron $K$ corresponding to it. Some algebraic structure will be introduced first.

## Free groups and relations

Recall our definitions of free Abelian group. However, here the modifier "Abelian" is emitted, and we will employ multiplicative notation for the group operation.

>**Definition (Free group)**: A subset $X=\\{x_j\\}$ of group $G$ is called a free set of generators of $G$ if $\forall g\in G-\\{e\\}$ is *uniquely* written as
>$$g=x^{i_1}_1\cdots x^{i_n}_n$$
>where $n$ is finite and $i_k\in \mathbb{Z}$.
