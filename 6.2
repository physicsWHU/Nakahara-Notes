## 6.2 de Rham cohomology groups

### 6.2.1 Definitions

We first introduce the cocycle group and coboundary group:
>**Definition 6.1** Let $M$ be an m dimensional  differentiable manifold. The set of
closed r-forms is called the rth cocycle group, denoted $Z^{r}(M)$. The set of exact
r-forms is called the rth coboundary group, denoted $B^{r}(M)$. These are vector
spaces with $R$-coefficients and we have $B^{r}(M)\subset Z^{r}(M)$. 
>**Deductions** 
>(a) If $\omega\in Z^{r}(M)$ and $\phi\in Z^{s}(M)$, then $\omega\wedge\phi\in Z^{r+s}(M)$
>(b) If $\omega\in Z^{r}(M)$ and $\phi\in B^{s}(M)$, then $\omega\wedge\phi\in B^{r+s}(M)$
>(c) If $\omega\in B^{r}(M)$ and $\phi\in B^{s}(M)$, then $\omega\wedge\phi\in B^{r+s}(M)$

>**Definition 6.2** The rth de Rham cohomology group is defined by $$H^{r}(M;R)=Z^{r}(M)/B^{r}(M)$$
>If $r\leq -1$ or $r\geq m+1$, $H^{r}(M;R)$ may be defined to be trivial.
